    faq_already_registered_question: "I already registered this computer! Why do I see this page again?"

    faq_limit_question: "Is there a limit to the types of programs I can use or a cap on my download?"
    faq_limit_answer_1: "Currently there are no restrictions when you use your computer correctly and legally. However, your computer may be temporarily disconnected if you create problems for the other users. Examples of those problems are worms blasting our network, illegal downloads prompting letters from copyright holders or spider crawlers downloading complete web pages."
    faq_limit_answer_2: "Thus it is imperative that you use an up-to-date virus scanner. However, you do not need a separate firewall - the builtin Windows Firewall is absolutely sufficient and 3rd party firewalls like ZoneAlarm are known to cause more problems than	solve them."

    faq: "FAQ"
    faq_nat_question: "Others cannot connect to my application XYZ (FTP-Server, Teamspeak-Server, VNC-Server...)!"
    faq_nat_answer_1: "This is due to the fact that you are inside a so-called NAT behind our router. Applications like browsers connect from inside the NAT to the outside - which means that our router knows which computer requested what data. However, if someone from the outside tries to connect to your computer, he will first run into our router which does not know anything about your computer requesting data. Thus blocking the connection request."
    faq_nat_answer_2: "In case of VNC there exists a workaround in the form of the program TeamViewer, which is free for private use."
    faq_nat_answer_3: "A real solution to the NAT problem does exist in the form of IPv6. Questions regarding a date for the actual implementation of this new protocol are to be directed towards the GWDG, though."
