    welcome: "Welcome to the Rosenbachweg!"

    access_answer_1: "Fill out the form below and take care to enter a"
    access_answer_2: "valid email adress!"
    access_answer_3: "After your entries are accepted, you will gain access to web pages (i.e. Port 80, 443). This means that web browsers like Firefox, Opera will work while programs like Skype or World of Warcraft will not."
    access_answer_4: "You will then receive an e-mail which contains a link you will have to click in order to confirm your e-mail address (alternatively you can use the included PIN and revisit this page). Upon confirmation of your e-mail address you will gain full access to the internet. You will have to access your emails by using your webbrowser."
    did_already_question: "But I already did all this / How do I register a new computer?"
    did_already_answer: "Please refer to the FAQ below the form."
    faq_already_registered_question: "I already registered this computer! Why do I see this page again?"
    faq_already_registered_answer: "This may be due to several reasons. For one, we delete computers which have been inactive for a longer period of time. Or it may be a simple clerical error. In both cases, simply enter your data again."
    faq_broken_question: "My old computer is broken and I got a new one!"
    faq_broken_answer: "Simply enter your information into the form. When asked if you want replace or add a computer, choose the former option."
    faq_additional_question: "I want to add an additional computer!"
    faq_additional_answer: "Simply enter your information into the form. When asked if you want replace or add a computer, choose the latter option. Alternatively, simply visit this page from your already registered computer. This way you can add devices which do not possess a browser like routers or a gaming console."
    faq_limit_question: "Is there a limit to the types of programs I can use or a cap on my download?"
    faq_limit_answer_1: "Currently there are no restrictions when you use your computer correctly and legally. However, your computer may be temporarily disconnected if you create problems for the other users. Examples of those problems are worms blasting our network, illegal downloads prompting letters from copyright holders or spider crawlers downloading complete web pages."
    faq_limit_answer_2: "Thus it is imperative that you use an up-to-date virus scanner. However, you do not need a separate firewall - the builtin Windows Firewall is absolutely sufficient and 3rd party firewalls like ZoneAlarm are known to cause more problems than	solve them."
    enter_information: "Please enter your information!"
    faq: "FAQ"
    faq_nat_question: "Others cannot connect to my application XYZ (FTP-Server, Teamspeak-Server, VNC-Server...)!"
    faq_nat_answer_1: "This is due to the fact that you are inside a so-called NAT behind our router. Applications like browsers connect from inside the NAT to the outside - which means that our router knows which computer requested what data. However, if someone from the outside tries to connect to your computer, he will first run into our router which does not know anything about your computer requesting data. Thus blocking the connection request."
    faq_nat_answer_2: "In case of VNC there exists a workaround in the form of the program TeamViewer, which is free for private use."
    faq_nat_answer_3: "A real solution to the NAT problem does exist in the form of IPv6. Questions regarding a date for the actual implementation of this new protocol are to be directed towards the GWDG, though."
